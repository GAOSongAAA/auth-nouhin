# Code Review

## Architecture & Design
- `CommonContextBindingFilter` logs context clearing before the filter chain executes, which may mislead the log order; move the log after `clearContext()`.
- Global context access through `ConfigManager` in filters and request wrappers can introduce thread-safety risks; consider using request-scoped beans or Spring's context facilities instead.

## Code Quality & Readability
- `SpringMVCUtil` shows inconsistent indentation and overuse of static utility methods; aligning formatting and considering dependency injection would improve maintainability.
- `ResponseForServlet` defines a non-standard method name `Source()`; rename to `getSource` to follow Java conventions.
- In `RequestForServlet.forward`, the chain `ConfigManager.getCommonContext().getResponse().Source()` and an `Object` return type reduce type safety and readability.
- `CommonAuthConfiguration` duplicates exclude patterns and relies on a broad `catch (Exception e)`; refining these areas will clarify intent.

## Spring Boot Best Practices
- Prefer constructor or explicit bean methods for dependency injection instead of setting static state via `CommonBeanInjection`.
- The authorization filter bean is created with chained configuration; extracting configuration properties or using `@ConfigurationProperties` could simplify management.

## Security
- `CommonAuthConfiguration` swallows authentication exceptions after logging, potentially allowing requests to proceed without proper authorization.
- Endpoints like `/login` in `NormalityCheckController` return static responses without authentication or input validation.

## Performance & Resource Management
- `ContextForSpringInJakartaServlet` instantiates new wrapper objects on each call; consider reusing objects or leveraging caching if they are stateless.
- `RequestForServlet.getParamMap` only retains the first value of multi-valued parameters, which may drop data for repeated keys.

## Testing
- The project lacks visible unit or integration tests. Running `mvn test` fails due to unresolved dependencies, hindering automated validation.
